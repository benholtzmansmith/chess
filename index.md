### d5 against the London

This is a short bit on exploiting a common line that gives black an edge against the London.

This set up plan is made goes d5 then c5 to open up the Queen to go to b6

Qb3 is the most popular reply, but c4 gaining space, forcing a queen trade and opening up the rook on a8 is actually quite good for black.

Important to play Bf5 and b5. The idea we are going for is to prompt white to play a3 and then Black will play Ne4 to remove Nd2 - the defender of b3 - and black can go for Na5.

h6 is a useful move here to threaten g5 where, Bg3 is met with h5 or if Nc6 bxc6, Be5 0-0, black plans Nd7 and h5

Ne4 forces the issue. If White plays Nef3, black plays f3 traps the night.

With the exchange of the knight on d2, Black can start pushing for Na4-b3

After a move like Re1, Black can execute their knight repositioning plan. White needs to find Bxc6, where even then Black has a nice edge because of their Queen side space with c5, swap on c5 to get the Bishop to c5, Ke7, Rd8, f6, g5
